## Hi there, I'm Francesco ðŸ‘‹
I'm a graduate student in Statistics at ETH Zurich, currently working on my Master's Thesis! My academic interests lie at the intersection of Statistics, Causality and Machine Learning.

At the moment, I'm exploring the fields of Causality and Distribution Generalization. Previously, I worked on some exciting projects in Astrophysics, focusing on Cosmology and Exoplanet Science. There, I applied nonparametric statistics and Bayesian methods to uncover fundamental insights about the universe!

Iâ€™m always open to new collaborations. Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss projects or share ideas!
